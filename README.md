# Least-Significant Bit Steganography 
A simple tool that uses the least-significant (LSB) bit technique of stenganography to hide messages inside images.

## How it works
Assuming you have a text file that has a message that you want to hide and an file that is compatible with the least-significant bit technique, you can employ this tool to append the message at the end.

Simply, you type in the name of your LSB-compatible file and press enter to submit it as input. Currently, this tool can only accept files that exist in the folder that contains the code, so you may not feed it a path.
Next, enter the name of your text file, that should contain the message to write to the LSB-compatible file.
If everything goes well, you should get a message saying something like "`Processing complete! [#] bytes written.`"
